I'm an Instructor at Mass General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, interested in developing improved approaches to personalized nutrition and lifestyle using genomic and bioinformatic methods. I received my PhD in Biochemical and Molecular Nutrition from Tufts University, and am now a part of the Manning Laboratory, where my work involves the development of software for large-scale gene-environment interaction analysis and its application in uncovering novel gene-diet interactions.

Some other things I think about:
* The future of food: What will we be eating in 20 years, and how will it be produced?
* Science: The academic research and publication system could be more effective than it is right now.
* Mental models: I'm a big fan of Shane Parrish's work at [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/).
